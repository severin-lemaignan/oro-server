<em>oro-server</em> is a Java-based ontology server. It can load RDF/OWL ontologies and allow RPC access to the ontology. RPC framework is provided by external middleware. Currently only YARP is supported, but the server has been designed with modularity in mind and it should be fairly easy to add new ones.<br/>
<br/>
The <em>{@link laas.openrobots.ontology.IOntologyServer IOntologyServer}</em> interface presents all the methods available to access and modify the ontology. The interface documentation provides detailled examples. Another source of example is the <em>{@link laas.openrobots.ontology.tests.OpenRobotsOntologyTest OpenRobotsOntologyTest}</em> class which contains about 15 unit tests, covering most of the API.
