<em>oro-server</em> is a Java-based knowledge base for cognitive robotic applications. It is developped at the LAAS-CNRS by S&eacute;verin Lemaignan (severin.lemaignan@laas.fr)<br/>

<h2>oro-server features</h2>

<em>oro-server</em> relies on RDF/OWL ontologies to represent an store knowledge and runs several active processes that offer reasonning facilities, support bio-inspired memory models, implement concepts of "cognitive events" and pro-active "curiosity", offer mechanisms to handle cognitive conflicts (ie inconsistent chuncks of knowledge), etc.

The main communication channel with <em>oro-server</em> is a simple socket interface. However several bridges and wrapper to higher-level framework are available (including a C++ object-oriented abstraction, a YARP connector, a JSON connector). New ones can be easily created on request.<br/>

<h2>Where to go?</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you just want to use the server, a good source of examples is the <em>{@link laas.openrobots.ontology.tests.OpenRobotsOntologyTest OpenRobotsOntologyTest}</em> class which contains about 15 unit tests, covering most of the API.</li>
<li>The socket communication protocol is documented here: {@link laas.openrobots.ontology.connectors.SocketConnector}</li>
<li>If you're interested in the server internal's, {@link laas.openrobots.ontology.OroServer} is the main entry point to the software.</li>
</ul>
