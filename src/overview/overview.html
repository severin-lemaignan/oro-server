<em>oro-server</em> is a Java-based server for RDF/OWL ontologies remote access. It can load RDF/OWL ontologies and allow RPC access to the ontology. RPC framework is provided by external middleware. Currently only YARP and JSON-RPC are supported, but the server has been designed with modularity in mind and it should be fairly easy to add new ones.<br/>
<br/>

The {@link laas.openrobots.ontology.OroServer} is the main entry point to the software. Please check the documentation there.<br/>
<br/>
A good source of examples (both in Java and with the YARP connector) is the <em>{@link laas.openrobots.ontology.tests.OpenRobotsOntologyTest OpenRobotsOntologyTest}</em> class which contains about 15 unit tests, covering most of the API.<br/>
