<em>oro-server</em> is a Java-based server for RDF/OWL ontologies remote access. It can load RDF/OWL ontologies and allow RPC access to the ontology. RPC framework is provided by external middleware. Currently only YARP is supported, but the server has been designed with modularity in mind and it should be fairly easy to add new ones.<br/>
<br/>

The {@link laas.openrobots.ontology.connectors.OroServer} class expose the different RPC implementation available. It's the best entry point regarding remote connection to the server.<br/>
<br/>
The <em>{@link laas.openrobots.ontology.IOntologyServer IOntologyServer}</em> interface presents all the methods available to access and modify the ontology. The interface documentation provides detailled examples. Another source of examples is the <em>{@link laas.openrobots.ontology.tests.OpenRobotsOntologyTest OpenRobotsOntologyTest}</em> class which contains about 15 unit tests, covering most of the API.<br/>
