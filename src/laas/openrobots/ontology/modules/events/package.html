Provides the cognitive event manager module.<br/>

<h3>Overview of the events usage</h3>

<p>
Events are triggered by so-called <i>Watchers</i> (classes that implement the 
{@link laas.openrobots.ontology.modules.events.IWatcher} interface).
<p/>

<p>
A watcher stores the type of event (cf {@link laas.openrobots.ontology.modules.events.IWatcher.EventType}) along with the
pattern (the form of the pattern depends on the type of event, as documented here:
{@link laas.openrobots.ontology.modules.events.IWatcher.EventType}).
</p>

<p>
For convenience, a generic watcher ({@link laas.openrobots.ontology.modules.events.GenericWatcher}) 
is provided, as well as more specialized ones like {@link laas.openrobots.ontology.modules.events.NewClassInstanceWatcher}.
</p>

<p>
The events can eventually be registered to an {@linkplain laas.openrobots.ontology.backends.IOntologyBackend ontology 
backend} by calling {@link laas.openrobots.ontology.backends.IOntologyBackend#registerEvent(IWatcher)}.
</p>

<p>
Examples can be found in the {@link laas.openrobots.ontology.tests.EventsTest} test-suite.
